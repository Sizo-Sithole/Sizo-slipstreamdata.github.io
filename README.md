## 💡 Project Ideas

**Problem:**  
Retail demand is volatile, influenced by promotions, seasonality, holidays, fuel prices, and even weather. Accurate forecasting is critical but challenging.

- Engineer features with **holiday calendars, weather data, inflation rates**  
- Compare **ETS, ARIMA** (classical methods) vs **LSTM networks** (ML approach)  
- Evaluate performance on accuracy & business impact  

**Impact:**  
✅ Optimize inventory planning  
✅ Reduce stockouts & overstocks  
✅ Improve customer satisfaction & profitability  

**Stretch Goal:**
