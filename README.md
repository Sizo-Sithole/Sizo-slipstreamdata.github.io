🔹 Mini Bio / Positioning Statement (max 10 pts)

“I am a Master’s in Industrial Engineering (Data Science stream) student at Stellenbosch University, passionate about applying data-driven methods to solve challenges in retail and supply chain resilience. My goal is to use advanced analytics and machine learning to create measurable business and social impact, especially in fast-moving consumer industries.”

🔹 Seed Project Ideas (max 15 pts)

Retail Demand Forecasting with External Factors
Build predictive models that incorporate promotions, holidays, and inflation data to improve demand planning for retailers. Compare ETS, ARIMA, and ML (XGBoost/LSTM) for accuracy.
Why relevant: Retail in South Africa is volatile, and better forecasting reduces stockouts and waste.

Supply Chain Risk & Resilience Modelling
Develop a risk-scoring system for retailers’ supply chains using SCOR v13 and ISO 31000 principles. Apply clustering and simulations to classify suppliers and test responses under disruptions like strikes or power cuts.
Why relevant: Helps managers identify and mitigate high-risk supply chain nodes.

🔹 Skills to Grow (max 10 pts)

Technical skill: Time-series forecasting & optimization
Why: Essential for retail demand prediction, risk modelling, and operations decision-making.

Soft skill: Stakeholder communication
Why: Translating technical outputs into actionable insights for managers is critical in data science roles.

🔹 Goals (30-Day + 6-Month) (max 10 pts)

30-Day Goal: Build and publish my GitHub portfolio with a starter project (e.g., exploratory analysis of retail sales data).

6-Month Goal: Complete at least two end-to-end projects (forecasting + supply chain risk model), documented with code, dashboards, and business insights, to showcase readiness for a data science role.
