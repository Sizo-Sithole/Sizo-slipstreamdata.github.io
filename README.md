## Project Ideas  

###  Retail Demand Forecasting  

One project idea I would like to explore is building a predictive model of customer purchase behaviour. For example, predicting when a customer might switch to a competitor or when they are likely to buy certain seasonal items could help design proactive loyalty campaigns and smarter stock planning. I see this problem like a credit risk problem (Probability of default) . in my project I will be modelling probability or likelihood of switching to competitor (call it Probability of Switching).

Approach:

Use transactional datasets of both internal and external.

Perform feature engineering to incorporate external data and give it meaning to the context of my project.

Apply some of the transferable theories of credit risk to the space of of "customer loss" if applicable ,if not the explore some other mathematical methods.

Impact:
Will help the Retial company to allocate resource as best as possible on marketing or customer retaining.

Stretch Goal:
Develop a customer “Switch Risk Early Warning System” that not only predicts the Probability of Switching (PoS) but also provides actionable intervention strategies.
